    The ``container_format`` and ``disk_format`` attributes have been made
    optional for ``image`` resources in Gnocchi. This fixes an issue where
    image resources would fail to be created in Gnocchi because
    ``container_format`` and ``disk_format`` are set to ``null`` (which is
    possible on images that haven't had data uploaded to them yet).
